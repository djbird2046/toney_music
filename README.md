## Why Toney Music Feels Different

Traditional players stop at playback. Toney Music leans heavily on AI Agents to build smarter, more personal listening sessions:

- **Contextual curation** powered by location, time, weather, trending topics, and mood signals.
- **Agent-guided playlist creation** where users can converse with an AI to generate bespoke mixes.
- **Private library tagging** to keep local collections organized effortlessly.
- **AI-powered song stories** that surface the history behind tracks, artists, production teams, plus community reactions.
- **More agent-driven experiences** are on the way as new workflows unlock.

## Current Status

- **UI framework**: Music AI hub, playlists, library, settings, and a persistent playback bar.
- **Implemented features**: playlist browsing, local library management, and a playback bar complete with the current queue.

## Roadmap / TODO

- **Library expansion**: integrate NetDisk, Samba, WebDAV, and NFS with path prefetching and download caching.
- **Music AI**: wire up LiteAgentSDK plus OpenTool callbacks to bridge agents and in-app controls.
- **Settings**: add localization plus light, dark, and system themes.
- **Platforms**: ship optimized builds for Windows, iOS, Android, and even HarmonyOS.
